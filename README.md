# instrumental-slayer

This is an express app utilizing handlebars, a MySQL database, and sequelize to create a battle-rpg based on attributes of individual music files. 
We used the music-tempo package to calculate duration, tempo, and beats per song to populate character stats,
and used put requests to the database to perform battle functions and stat updates.
